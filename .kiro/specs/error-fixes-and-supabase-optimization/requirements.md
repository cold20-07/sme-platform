# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical errors and optimization issues in the SME Platform application. The project currently has several configuration problems, missing dependencies, build issues, and needs optimization for Supabase MCP integration. This spec will systematically fix these issues while ensuring the application works seamlessly with Supabase's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for data operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Configuration and Build Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build and run without errors, so that I can develop and deploy the platform successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN Next.js configuration is processed THEN it SHALL support both static export and dynamic features appropriately
3. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN they SHALL have proper fallbacks and validation
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL not throw runtime errors related to missing dependencies

### Requirement 2: Optimize Supabase Integration and Database Schema

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database schema and Supabase integration to be properly structured and optimized, so that data operations are efficient and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database types are defined THEN they SHALL match the actual Supabase schema structure
2. WHEN MCP operations are performed THEN the application SHALL handle them efficiently with proper error handling
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use proper indexes and relationships
4. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN it SHALL properly integrate with Supabase Auth and create necessary profile records

### Requirement 3: Fix Component and Hook Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components and hooks to work correctly without missing dependencies or runtime errors, so that the user interface functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL not throw errors related to missing imports or dependencies
2. WHEN hooks are used THEN they SHALL have proper dependency arrays and cleanup functions
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN they SHALL handle validation and error states correctly
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN it SHALL work seamlessly between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### Requirement 4: Implement Proper Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and show appropriate loading states, so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the application SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN data is loading THEN the application SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL receive clear feedback about the issue
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the application SHALL handle them gracefully with retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Optimize Performance and Bundle Size

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and perform efficiently, so that I can use the platform without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL minimize bundle size through proper code splitting
2. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL use React best practices for performance optimization
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL use efficient caching strategies with React Query
4. WHEN images and assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery

### Requirement 6: Enhance Supabase MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to leverage Supabase MCP capabilities effectively, so that database operations are streamlined and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP tools are available THEN the application SHALL utilize them for database operations
2. WHEN schema changes occur THEN they SHALL be reflected in the TypeScript types automatically
3. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN they SHALL use MCP's advanced querying capabilities
4. WHEN real-time features are required THEN they SHALL leverage Supabase's real-time subscriptions through MCP
